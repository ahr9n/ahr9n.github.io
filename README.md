My personal website. 

## Overview
Designed and developed with a conscious effort to avoid using any superfluous frameworks like Bootstrap. 

## Getting Started
First, you need to install ruby using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#readme) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) according to their [docs](https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/), then:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ahr9n/ahr9n.github.io.git
$ cd ahr9n.github.io
$ ./run.sh
```

## Topics
Built with Jekyll, Handlebars (Dependencies: [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)), SCSS, JavaScript, and Github Pages.
